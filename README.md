# Web-Scraping

Web Data Scarping  is a technique that automatically scans content from websites

And process it in order to display it as you wish.

The algorithm that performs the "scratching" usually also includes a type of artificial intelligence that knows how to separate different pieces of information such as people's names, technical details, photos, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and so on, so you can enter any of these types of information To a separate field in the database used by the algorithm (hence the information obtained is ultimately considered structured data).

In the code I wrote I wanted to collect information from a particular site (price, model, link to the Specific model and more) about different models of laptops.
